### [Cubic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_equation)

> An example of a Galois group $A_3$ with three elements is given by $p(x) = x^3 − 3x − 1$, whose discriminant is $81 = 9^2$.

Let $\omega$ be a primitive 18th root of unity, then

$$\displaylines{a = \omega - \omega^8 \\
b = \omega^5 - \omega^4 \\
c = \omega^7 - \omega^2}$$

are solutions of $p(x) = x^3 − 3x − 1$. The following relations hold:

$$\displaylines{a^2 + c = b^2 + a \\
b^2 + a = c^2 + b \\
c^2 + b = a^2 + c}$$
