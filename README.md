### [Cubic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_equation)

> An example of a Galois group $A_3$ with three elements is given by $p(x) = x^3 − 3x − 1$, whose discriminant is $81 = 9^2$.

Let $\omega$ be a primitive 18th root of unity.
Note, this implies $\omega^9 = -1$
and
$\omega^3 - \omega^6 = 1$
. Then

$$\displaylines{a := \omega^7 - \omega^2 \approx -1.5320888862379558}\\
b := \omega^5 - \omega^4 \approx -0.3472963553338607\\
c := \omega - \omega^8 \approx 1.8793852415718169$$

are the solutions of $x^3 − 3x = 1$. There are three algebraic relations between these numbers:

$$\displaylines{a^2 + b = 2 \\
b^2 + c = 2 \\
c^2 + a = 2}$$
